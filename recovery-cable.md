"Dear Customer:

Thank you for choosing Flame Developer phone.

Here we want to remind you the recovery cable, sent with Flame outside of the giftbox with red label “Recovery Cable”.

This cable is only for EMERGENCY situation, and it is to rescue Flame when it is in ‘dead’ mode—a status that your Flame cannot power up by long-pressing the POWER button. This status is RARE in normal using. In case you phone is “dead”, please contact technical support flameservice@thundersoft.com for recovery cable’s operation instruction. 

This recovery cable is NOT an normal USB cable, please keep it carefully and use the USB cable inside of the giftbox for daily use. Thank you very much. "
